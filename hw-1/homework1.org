Instructions: All calculations should be performed in python. You should turn in the code used, and the answers you got.

https://github.com/jkitchin/dft-course and
https://github.com/jkitchin/dft-book.

* Read Chapter 1 in the text book.
You do not need to write anything. Just do it.
* Read Section 5 (Molecules) in dft-book.
As part of this assignment, please turn in a pdf copy of dft-book that has been annotated by sticky notes using Adobe Acrobat Reader (you should be able to type Ctrl-6 to get a sticky note while the pdf is open, and then you can move it where you want and type text in it.). Please note any typos, places that are confusing, etc...

* Data fitting.
Fit a cubic polynomial to this set of data and estimate the lattice constant that minimizes the total energy. Prepare a figure that shows the data, your fit and your estimated minimum. Hints: =numpy.polyfit=, =numpy.polyder=, =numpy.roots=, =numpy.linspace=, =numpy.polyval= will all help you do this easily.

#+tblname: cu-fcc-energies
| lattice constant ($\AA$) | Total Energy (eV) |
|--------------------------+-------------------|
|                      3.5 |         -3.649238 |
|                     3.55 |         -3.696204 |
|                      3.6 |         -3.719946 |
|                     3.65 |         -3.723951 |
|                      3.7 |         -3.711284 |
|                     3.75 |          -3.68426 |

* Nonlinear algebra
Solve this equation: $\sin(x^2) = 0.5$ for $x$. Prepare a plot of the function and show where your solution is. Hint: =scipy.optimize.fsolve=

* Linear algebra
Solve these equations using python and linear algebra:

\begin{eqnarray}
a0 - 3 a1 + 9 a2 - 27 a3 = -2 \\
a0 - a1 + a2 - a3 = 2 \\
a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 = 5 \\
a0 + 2a1 + 4 a2 + 8 a3 = 1
\end{eqnarray}

Use linear algebra to verify your solution. Hint: see =numpy.linalg=, =numpy.dot=.
